A formal learning phase that provided a rigorous approach and enabled me to tackle subjects that I wouldn't have tackled otherwise, followed by a personal learning phase that enabled me to delve deeper into the subjects covered in class, to look at them from a different perspective or to extend my knowledge to fields that aren't covered in a formal setting.\n\nThis methodology has enabled me to develop skills in modern technologies that are of interest to me for my future career, particularly in the fields of software engineering and the web, while at the same time structuring my development practices.",
